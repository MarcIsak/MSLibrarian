Task 1 (GUI): 

Use a file dialog box to locate the path of a DIA MS file (*.raw) which will be processed further on.

Task 2 (GUI): 

Call a function which launches msconvert.exe, a program which converts the input DIA MS-file from the vendor format (*.raw) to a DIA-Umpire compatible format (*.mzXML).

Some default settings are required to make it work.
